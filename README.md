## Network Notebooks

___

## Intro:

These are a collection of notebooks explaing and coding solutions to some graph and network theory ideas. They're reasonably mathematically informal and I'm intending on focusing mostly on the algorithms.

__Disclaimer__: _While the concepts I introduce here are I think correct, i'm definetly not known for being perfect. If you havppen to be reading and spot a mistake please let me know_

## Index:

1. __Random Walks on Gaphs__: Introduces graph structure, transistion matricies, random walks, density/probability vectors, orbits and convergence
2. __Metropolis Hastings Algorithm__: (In Progress) ...


All the classes I build in the notebooks are also in the graph.py file.

## Setup:

You'll need python3. I'd advise setting the repo up in a virtual environment as so:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```
